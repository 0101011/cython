Cython's entire documentation suite is currently being overhauled.

For the time being, I will use this page to post notes to both myself and to any interested parties that come to view my progress.

The prvious Cython documentation files are hosted at http://hg.cython.org/cython-docs

For my vistors
===============

1) This is creative process not necessarily a predetermined blueprint of what I may have in mind.
2) It's also an iterative process.
3) All constructive thoughts, visions, and criticisms most welcome.. :)


For me :)
=========

1) Some css work should definately be done.
2) Use local 'top-of-page' contents rather than the sidebar, imo.
3) Provide a link from each (sub)section to the TOC of the page.
4) Temporarily using bold emphisis everywhere to signify special markup to be addressed later.
