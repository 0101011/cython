* Make a Pygments lexer for cython/pyrex so we get nice color coding.
* Fix up the latex style file so that boxes are not messed up when we have
  code examples.
* Put on my writing hat, and do an overhaul of the structure of the docs so
  that it is faster to navigate. I will be using the python doc structure as a
  reference.
* Get some simple howto's written.
* Thinking if there is an easy way to test the cython code in the docs so that
  I can ensure accuracy.
